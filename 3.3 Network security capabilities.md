# Understanding Network Security

In this lesson, we’ll explore various tools and techniques used to keep networks secure:

- Traditional Firewalls
- Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
- Cloud Security Groups
- Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
- Load Balancers
- Bastion Hosts
- Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
- DDoS Protection

## Traditional Firewalls

Traditional firewalls are devices that monitor and control network traffic based on a set of rules. They create a barrier between trusted internal networks and external networks, blocking unauthorized access and potential threats.

## Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)

Web Application Firewalls are designed to protect web applications from threats like SQL injection and cross-site scripting. They filter and monitor HTTP requests and responses, blocking harmful traffic before it can reach your web application.

## Cloud Security Groups

Cloud security groups are like virtual firewalls that control the flow of traffic to and from cloud resources like virtual machines. They allow you to define rules to permit or block certain types of traffic, adding an extra layer of security to your cloud environment.

## Content Delivery Network (CDN)

A Content Delivery Network is a group of servers spread across different locations. CDNs speed up website performance by serving content from the server closest to the user. They also help protect against DDoS attacks by spreading traffic across many servers.

## Load Balancers

Load balancers help distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure resources are used efficiently, improve performance, and keep the network running smoothly. They prevent any single server from being overwhelmed by too much traffic.

## Bastion Hosts

Bastion hosts are secure servers that act as gateways for administrators to access internal networks from outside. They are isolated and equipped with strong security features to protect against unauthorized access.

## Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

VPNs create secure, encrypted connections between your device and a remote server, protecting your data from being intercepted on public networks. VPNs are often used to access internal networks remotely, giving the impression that you’re on the same local network.

## DDoS Protection

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection services defend against attacks where multiple devices flood a network or service, trying to overwhelm it. These services filter out malicious traffic to ensure legitimate users can still access the network.
