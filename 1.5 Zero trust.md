# Zero Trust

“Zero trust” is a term frequently mentioned in cybersecurity circles. But what does it really mean? Is it just a buzzword? In this lesson, we’ll dive into what zero trust is all about.

## Introduction

In this lesson, we’ll cover:

- What is zero trust?
- How does zero trust differ from traditional security architectures?
- What is defense in depth?

## Zero Trust

Zero Trust is a cybersecurity approach that challenges the traditional notion of "trust but verify" by assuming that no entity, whether inside or outside an organization's network, should be inherently trusted. Instead, Zero Trust advocates verifying every user, device, and application attempting to access resources, regardless of their location. The core principle of Zero Trust is to minimize the "attack surface" and reduce the potential impact of security breaches.

### Principles of Zero Trust:

1. **Verify Identity**: Authentication and authorization are rigorously applied to all users and devices, regardless of their location. Identities can include users, devices, applications, and more.
   
2. **Least Privilege**: Users and devices are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks, reducing the potential damage if compromised.

3. **Micro-Segmentation**: Network resources are divided into smaller segments to limit lateral movement within the network in case of a breach.

4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing monitoring and analysis of user and device behavior are conducted to detect anomalies and potential threats. Modern monitoring techniques use machine learning, AI, and threat intelligence to provide additional detail and context.

5. **Data Encryption**: Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorized access.

6. **Strict Access Control**: Access controls are enforced based on context, such as user roles, device health, and network location.

Microsoft separates zero trust into five pillars, which we will discuss in a later lesson.

## Differences from Traditional Security Architectures

Zero Trust differs from traditional security architectures, such as perimeter-based models, in several ways:

1. **Perimeter vs. Identity-Centric**: Traditional models focus on securing the perimeter of the network and assuming that internal users and devices can be trusted once inside. Zero Trust assumes that threats can originate from both inside and outside the network and enforces strict identity-based controls.

2. **Implicit vs. Explicit Trust**: Traditional models implicitly trust devices and users within the network until proven otherwise. Zero Trust explicitly verifies identities and continuously monitors for anomalies.

3. **Flat vs. Segmented Network**: Traditional architectures often involve flat networks where internal users have broad access. Zero Trust advocates segmenting the network into smaller, isolated zones to contain potential breaches.

4. **Reactive vs. Proactive**: Traditional security often relies on reactive measures such as perimeter firewalls and intrusion detection. Zero Trust takes a proactive approach by assuming breaches are likely and minimizing their impact.

## Defense in Depth

Defense in depth, also known as layered security, is a cybersecurity strategy that involves deploying multiple layers of security controls and measures to protect an organization's assets. The goal is to create overlapping layers of defense so that if one layer is breached, others can still provide protection. Each layer focuses on a different aspect of security and increases the overall security posture of an organization.

### Components of Defense in Depth:

1. **Technical Controls**: Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, antivirus software, and encryption.
   
2. **Procedural Controls**: Security policies, access controls, and incident response plans.

3. **Physical Controls**: Locks, surveillance cameras, and security personnel.

The idea is to create multiple barriers that collectively make it difficult for attackers to penetrate an organization's systems and networks. This approach is sometimes known as the "Swiss cheese" model, where multiple layers of defense compensate for the weaknesses in any single layer, similar to how the holes in slices of Swiss cheese are aligned to create a solid barrier.
