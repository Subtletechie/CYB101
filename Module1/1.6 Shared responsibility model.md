# The Shared Responsibility Model

The concept of shared responsibility emerged with the rise of cloud computing. It is essential for understanding the division of security roles between cloud service providers (CSPs) and customers, ensuring no gaps in cybersecurity defenses.

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll cover:

- What is shared responsibility in cybersecurity?
- How does shared responsibility differ across IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?
- Where can you find information about the security controls provided by your cloud platform?
- What does "trust but verify" mean?

## What is shared responsibility in the context of cybersecurity?

Shared responsibility in cybersecurity means that both the cloud service provider (CSP) and the customer have roles in securing data, applications, and systems. The CSP manages certain security aspects while the customer is responsible for others. This division of responsibilities is crucial for maintaining a secure cloud environment.

## What is the difference in shared responsibility for security controls between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?

The division of responsibilities varies depending on the type of cloud service:

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: The CSP provides and secures the infrastructure (servers, networking, storage). The customer manages and secures the operating systems, applications, and data on this infrastructure.

- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: The CSP manages the infrastructure and the platform, while the customer is responsible for the security of the applications they build and the data they manage on the platform.

- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: The CSP handles everything, including the infrastructure, platform, and applications. The customer focuses on managing user access and securing data usage.

Understanding these distinctions helps prevent misunderstandings about who is responsible for which security controls, ensuring comprehensive security measures are in place.

## Where can you find out what security controls your cloud platform is providing?

To understand the security controls offered by your cloud platform, refer to the following sources:

- **CSP's Website and Documentation**: Detailed information about security features and controls can be found on the CSP's website, including whitepapers, security guides, and technical documentation.

- **Security Assessments and Audits**: Independent security experts and organizations often assess CSPs. These assessments provide insights into the effectiveness of the CSP's security measures and may result in security compliance certifications.

- **Security Compliance Certifications**: Certifications such as ISO 27001, SOC 2, and FedRAMP demonstrate that the CSP meets specific security and compliance standards.

Always consult official and up-to-date resources from the cloud service provider to make informed decisions about the security of your cloud-based assets.

## What is "trust but verify"?

"Trust but verify" means that while an organization might initially trust a CSP or third-party software provider's claims about their security measures, they should also verify these claims through:

- **Security Assessments**: Regularly evaluating the security measures in place.
- **Penetration Testing**: Conducting tests to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Review of Security Controls**: Ensuring the external party's security controls meet your requirements before full integration.

Organizations should apply this principle to ensure the security of all components they are not directly managing.

## Shared responsibility within an organization

Within an organization, security responsibilities should also be shared among different teams. The security team collaborates with operations, developers, and other departments to implement comprehensive security measures.
