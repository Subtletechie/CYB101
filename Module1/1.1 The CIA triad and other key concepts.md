## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll cover:

- What is cybersecurity?
- What is the cybersecurity CIA triad?
- What are authenticity, nonrepudiation, and privacy in the context of cybersecurity?

## What is cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity, also known as information security, involves protecting computer systems, networks, devices, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, damage, or theft. The primary objective is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital assets and information. Cybersecurity professionals develop and implement security measures to safeguard these assets. As our lives become increasingly digital, cybersecurity has become a crucial concern for individuals and organizations alike.

### Key Objectives of Cybersecurity

1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to those authorized to access it.
2. **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data.
3. **Availability**: Ensuring that information and resources are available to authorized users when needed.

Cybersecurity encompasses various practices, including network security, application security, information security, and operational security. It also involves educating users about the best practices for protecting their data.

## What is the cybersecurity CIA triad?

The cybersecurity CIA triad is a foundational model that outlines the three primary goals of any cybersecurity initiative: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These principles guide the design and implementation of security measures to protect digital assets.

### Confidentiality

Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to those authorized to access it. It involves protecting data from unauthorized access and disclosure. Measures to maintain confidentiality include encryption, access controls, and authentication mechanisms. Confidentiality is crucial for safeguarding personal information, financial data, and intellectual property.

#### Examples:
- Encrypting sensitive emails to protect the information from unauthorized access.
- Implementing role-based access controls to restrict access to confidential data.

### Integrity

Integrity involves maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data. It ensures that information is not altered or tampered with by unauthorized parties. Integrity is maintained through mechanisms such as checksums, hashing, and digital signatures. This principle is vital for ensuring that data remains reliable and trustworthy.

#### Examples:
- Using checksums to verify the integrity of downloaded files.
- Implementing version control systems to track changes and maintain the accuracy of documents.

### Availability

Availability ensures that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed. It involves implementing measures to maintain the uptime and functionality of systems. Availability is critical for business continuity and disaster recovery. Security measures include redundancy, load balancing, and backup solutions.

#### Examples:
- Using redundant systems to ensure continuous availability of critical services.
- Implementing backup solutions to restore data in case of a system failure.

## What are authenticity, nonrepudiation, and privacy in the context of cybersecurity?

These additional concepts are essential for ensuring the security and trustworthiness of systems and data:

### Authenticity

Authenticity ensures that the information, communication, or entity you are interacting with is genuine and has not been tampered with. It involves verifying the identity of users and systems to prevent impersonation and fraud. Measures to ensure authenticity include digital signatures, certificates, and multi-factor authentication.

#### Examples:
- Using digital signatures to verify the authenticity of documents.
- Implementing multi-factor authentication to confirm the identity of users.

### Nonrepudiation

Nonrepudiation ensures that a party cannot deny their involvement in a transaction or communication. It provides proof of the origin and integrity of data, making it impossible for someone to dispute their actions. Nonrepudiation is achieved through mechanisms such as digital signatures and audit logs.

#### Examples:
- Using digital signatures to provide proof of the sender's identity and the integrity of the message.
- Maintaining audit logs to track and verify user actions and transactions.

### Privacy

Privacy involves protecting sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII) from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or manipulation. It involves implementing controls to regulate who has access to personal data and how it is collected, stored, and shared. Privacy measures include data anonymization, encryption, and access controls.

#### Examples:
- Encrypting personal data to protect it from unauthorized access.
- Implementing data minimization practices to reduce the amount of collected and stored personal information.
