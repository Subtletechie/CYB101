## What is a cybersecurity threat?

A cybersecurity threat is any potential danger that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data and IT systems. These threats can come from various sources, including malicious hackers, insider threats, and even accidental human error. The primary goal of these threats is to exploit vulnerabilities within systems to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, disrupt services, or inflict damage.

### Key Elements of Cybersecurity Threats:

1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
2. **Integrity**: Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods.
3. **Availability**: Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when required.

Understanding these elements is crucial in identifying and mitigating potential threats effectively.

## Why do malicious actors want to compromise data and IT systems?

Hackers have diverse motivations for targeting data and IT systems. Recognizing these motivations helps in developing effective defense mechanisms. Some common reasons include:

1. **Financial Gain**: 
   - **Data Theft**: Hackers steal sensitive information such as credit card numbers, bank account details, and personal identification information to commit fraud or identity theft.
   - **Ransomware**: Attackers encrypt files and demand ransom for the decryption key.

2. **Espionage**:
   - **Corporate Espionage**: Competitors may steal proprietary information to gain a market advantage.
   - **State-Sponsored Attacks**: Nations conduct cyber espionage to gain political, economic, or military insights.

3. **Disruption and Sabotage**:
   - **Critical Infrastructure Attacks**: Disrupting essential services like power grids, water supplies, and communication networks.
   - **Denial of Service**: Overloading systems to make them unavailable to users.

4. **Ideological Motivations**:
   - **Hacktivism**: Groups with political or ideological agendas compromise systems to promote their beliefs or protest against specific actions or organizations.

5. **Unintentional Actions**:
   - **Social Engineering**: Manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information.
   - **Compromised Networks**: Unknowingly becoming part of a botnet used for larger attacks.

## What are the most common types of cybersecurity threats?

Several prevalent types of cyber threats include:

1. **Phishing**:
   - **Description**: Deceptive emails or messages that appear legitimate to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information.
   - **Impact**: Can lead to identity theft, financial loss, or unauthorized access to systems.

2. **Malware**:
   - **Ransomware**: Encrypts files and demands ransom for decryption.
   - **Trojans**: Malicious software disguised as legitimate applications.
   - **Viruses**: Self-replicating programs that spread by attaching themselves to files.
   - **Worms**: Standalone malware that replicates and spreads across networks.

3. **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**:
   - **Description**: Overloading a system with traffic to make it unavailable.
   - **Impact**: Disrupts services and can cause significant downtime.

4. **SQL Injection**:
   - **Description**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications to execute malicious SQL queries.
   - **Impact**: Unauthorized access to databases and potential data breaches.

5. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
   - **Description**: Injecting malicious scripts into web applications, which are then executed by users' browsers.
   - **Impact**: Can lead to data theft, session hijacking, and spreading malware.

6. **Social Engineering**:
   - **Description**: Manipulating individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information.
   - **Impact**: Can bypass security measures and lead to data breaches.

7. **Zero-Day (0day) Exploits**:
   - **Description**: Exploiting unknown vulnerabilities in software or hardware.
   - **Impact**: Highly dangerous as there are no patches available at the time of the exploit.

8. **Credential Attacks**:
   - **Brute Force**: Repeatedly guessing passwords to gain access.
   - **Credential Stuffing**: Using stolen credentials from one site to access accounts on other sites.

## What is the MITRE ATT&CK framework?

The [MITRE ATT&CK framework](https://attack.mitre.org/) (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a comprehensive resource that categorizes and details the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cyber adversaries. Created by the MITRE Corporation, this framework is widely used by cybersecurity professionals for understanding and defending against cyber threats.

### Key Features of the MITRE ATT&CK Framework:

1. **Standardized Language**: Provides a common language for describing adversary behavior.
2. **Real-World Examples**: Documents real-world attack behaviors and methods.
3. **Defense Strategies**: Helps in planning and implementing effective defense mechanisms.
4. **Incident Response**: Aids in identifying and mitigating techniques used in cyberattacks.

The framework is organized into matrices that group attack techniques by specific platforms (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux, cloud services) and tactics (e.g., initial access, execution, persistence). It continuously evolves with new threat intelligence, making it an invaluable resource for enhancing cybersecurity defenses.
