## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll learn about the key tools and techniques that help protect software applications from security threats.

## Core Tools and Techniques in Application Security

Securing applications is all about finding, fixing, and preventing security issues in software. Below are some of the most important tools and methods used in application security:

**1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**

- **What It Does**: SAST checks the application's code (like the source code or binary code) for security problems.
- **Examples of Tools**: Tools like Fortify, Checkmarx, and Veracode are commonly used for this purpose.

**2. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**

- **What It Does**: DAST looks for vulnerabilities by testing the application while it’s running, sending inputs, and observing the responses.
- **Examples of Tools**: Popular tools include ZAP, Burp Suite, and Qualys Web Application Scanning.

**3. Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)**

- **What It Does**: IAST combines the benefits of SAST and DAST, testing the code during runtime to get more accurate results with fewer false alarms.
- **Examples of Tools**: Contrast Security and HCL AppScan are examples of IAST tools.

**4. Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)**

- **What It Does**: RASP keeps an eye on applications while they’re running, protecting them from threats in real-time.
- **Examples of Tools**: Tools like Veracode Runtime Protection and F5 Advanced WAF with RASP are used for this.

**5. Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**

- **What It Does**: WAFs act as a shield between your application and the internet, filtering out harmful traffic.
- **Examples of Tools**: Examples include ModSecurity, AWS WAF, and Akamai Kona Site Defender.

**6. Dependency Scanning**

- **What It Does**: This checks third-party libraries and components for known vulnerabilities.
- **Examples of Tools**: Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and Snyk help with this task.

**7. Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)**

- **What It Does**: Pen Testing simulates real-world attacks to find vulnerabilities and assess the security of an application.
- **Who Performs It**: Certified ethical hackers and security experts use tools like Metasploit and Nmap for these tests.

**8. Security Scanning and Analysis**

- **What It Does**: This involves scanning applications for known security issues and configuration mistakes.
- **Examples of Tools**: Popular tools include Nessus, Qualys Vulnerability Management, and OpenVAS.

**9. Container Security Tools**

- **What It Does**: These tools focus on securing applications that run in containers, along with their environments.
- **Examples of Tools**: Docker Security Scanning and Aqua Security are common examples.

**10. Secure Development Training**

- **What It Does**: Training programs help developers learn and adopt secure coding practices.
- **Examples of Tools**: Customized training platforms are used to deliver these programs.

**11. Security Testing Frameworks**

- **What It Does**: These frameworks provide comprehensive methods for testing different aspects of application security.
- **Examples of Tools**: OWASP Amass, OWASP OWTF, and FrAppSec are examples.

**12. Secure Code Review Tools**

- **What It Does**: These tools review source code to find security vulnerabilities and ensure best coding practices are followed.
- **Examples of Tools**: SonarQube and Checkmarx are popular tools for code reviews.

**13. Secure APIs and Microservices Tools**

- **What It Does**: These tools help secure APIs and microservices, focusing on authentication, authorization, and data protection.
- **Examples of Tools**: Examples include Apigee, AWS API Gateway, and Istio.
