# Insighht on Security Practices and Documentation

You may have heard terms like "security policy," "security standard," and similar phrases before. However, many cybersecurity professionals often misuse them. This section will explain what each of these terms means and why they are essential for an organization.

## Introduction

In this lesson, weâ€™ll cover:

- What is a security policy?
- What is a security standard?
- What is a security baseline?
- What is a security guideline?
- What is a security procedure?
- What are laws and regulations in the context of cybersecurity?

These terms are often used in cybersecurity to define different levels of security documentation and practices within an organization. Let's clarify each term:

## What is a security policy?

A security policy is a high-level document that outlines an organization's overall security goals, principles, and guidelines. It provides a framework for making security-related decisions and sets the tone for the organization's security posture. Security policies typically cover topics such as acceptable use of resources, data protection, access control, incident response, and more. These policies are solution and technology-independent, meaning they provide a broad overview without getting into technical specifics. An example of a security policy is an organization's acceptable use policy, which dictates how organizational resources should be used.

## What is a security standard?

A security standard is a more detailed document that provides specific guidelines and requirements for implementing security controls within an organization. Unlike policies, standards are more concrete and technical, offering precise instructions and recommendations for configuring and maintaining systems, networks, and processes to meet security goals. An example of a security standard is: "All internal data must be encrypted at rest and in transit."

## What is a security baseline?

A security baseline is a set of minimum security configurations essential for a particular system, application, or environment at a specific point in time. It defines a starting point for security that should be consistently implemented across all relevant instances. Security baselines help ensure uniformity and a certain level of security throughout an organization's IT infrastructure. An example of a security baseline is: "Azure VMs must not have direct Internet access."

## What is a security guideline?

A security guideline is a document that offers recommendations and guidance when a specific security standard does not apply. Guidelines address the "gray areas" that standards may not fully cover, providing best practices and advice on securing systems and processes. Unlike standards, guidelines are not mandatory but are recommended for achieving optimal security.

## What is a security procedure?

A security procedure is a detailed, step-by-step guide that outlines specific actions and tasks needed to execute a security-related process or task. Procedures are practical and actionable documents that provide a clear sequence of actions to follow during various activities, such as incident response, system maintenance, and user onboarding. An example of a security procedure is: "When a P1 security incident is generated by Microsoft Sentinel, the Security Operations Center (SOC) must immediately inform the on-call security manager and send the details of the incident to them."

In summary, these terms represent different levels of documentation and guidance within an organization's cybersecurity framework. Security policies set high-level goals, standards provide detailed requirements, baselines establish minimum security configurations, guidelines offer best practices, and procedures offer actionable steps for security processes.

## What are laws/regulations in the context of cybersecurity?

Laws and regulations refer to legal frameworks established by governments and regulatory bodies to define and enforce rules, standards, and requirements for securing digital systems, data, and information. These laws and regulations vary by jurisdiction and focus on different aspects of cybersecurity, including data protection, privacy, incident reporting, and the security of critical infrastructure. Examples of cybersecurity-related laws and regulations include:

- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Focuses on data protection and privacy in the European Union.
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Regulates the protection of health information in the United States.
- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Enhances privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California, USA.
- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**: Sets standards for secure handling of payment card information.
