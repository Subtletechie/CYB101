### **IAM Key Concepts Made Simple**

Have you ever signed into a computer or a website? If so, you've already interacted with identity controls! Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a crucial part of cybersecurity, and we'll explore it in the upcoming lessons.

### **Lesson Overview**

In this lesson, we'll discuss:

- What IAM (Identity and Access Management) means in cybersecurity.
- What the principle of least privilege is.
- What segregation of duties means.
- What authentication and authorization are.

### **What is IAM in Cybersecurity?**

IAM stands for Identity and Access Management. It's a set of processes, tools, and rules that help ensure the right people have the right access to an organization’s digital resources, like systems, data, and networks. The main purpose of IAM is to make security better, simplify how users access what they need, and follow company policies and laws. IAM includes things like:

- Making sure users prove who they are (authentication).
- Deciding what users are allowed to do (authorization).
- Creating and managing user accounts.
- Controlling who can access what resources.
- Handling the whole user account lifecycle, from creation to deletion.

### **What is the Principle of Least Privilege?**

The principle of least privilege means giving users only the minimum access they need to do their job. This reduces the risk if something goes wrong, like a security breach. By limiting access, organizations make it harder for unauthorized people to cause harm. For example, if all you need is to read a document, you shouldn’t be given full control over it.

### **What is Separation of Duties?**

Separation or segregation of duties is about dividing up critical tasks so that no one person has complete control over everything. This prevents mistakes and reduces the chance of fraud. In cybersecurity, this might mean that one person handles setting up a system, while another checks and approves the work. This ensures checks and balances, making it harder for any one person to do something wrong without being noticed.

### **What are Authentication and Authorization?**

**Authentication** is about verifying who you are. It’s how a system checks that you’re the right person trying to log in. Common methods include:

- **Something you know**: like a password or PIN.
- **Something you have**: like a security token or phone.
- **Something you are**: like a fingerprint or face scan.

**Authorization** comes after authentication and decides what you’re allowed to do once you’ve logged in. It controls what actions you can take and what data you can access based on your role and permissions.

**To summarize:**

- **Authentication** confirms your identity.
- **Authorization** determines what you can do once you're authenticated.
