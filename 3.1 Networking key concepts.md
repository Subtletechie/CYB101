# Core Networking key concepts


You've probably come across networking concepts if you've worked in IT. While identity is our main focus for securing modern environments, network controls are still important. This lesson will introduce you to some key networking ideas.

In this lesson, we'll explore:
What is IP addressing?
What is the OSI model?
What is TCP/UDP?
What are port numbers?
What is encryption at rest and in transit?
What is IP Addressing?
IP addressing, or Internet Protocol addressing, is a way to label each device connected to a network, like the internet. It’s like giving each device its own unique address so they can send and receive data. There are two main types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6.

IPv4: This is the older version and looks like this: 192.168.1.1.
IPv6: This is the newer version and looks like this: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.
These addresses help devices find each other and communicate over networks like the internet.

What is the OSI Model?
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a framework that helps us understand how data travels from one device to another over a network. It’s divided into seven layers, each with a specific role. These layers ensure that data moves smoothly and reliably between devices.

Here are the layers from bottom to top:

Physical Layer: Deals with the physical connection between devices.
Data Link Layer: Manages data transfer between devices on the same network.
Network Layer: Determines the best path for data to travel.
Transport Layer: Ensures data is sent and received correctly.
Session Layer: Manages sessions between devices.
Presentation Layer: Translates data formats between devices.
Application Layer: Interacts with software applications.
The OSI model is like a blueprint that helps us understand how different networking protocols and technologies work together.

What is TCP/UDP?
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two key protocols that help devices communicate over the internet or within a network. They break data into packets for sending and put it back together when it arrives. However, they work in different ways:

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): TCP is all about reliability. It creates a connection between devices, makes sure data arrives in the right order, and resends any lost packets. This is ideal for tasks like web browsing, emailing, or downloading files where accuracy is essential.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol): UDP is faster but less reliable. It doesn’t set up a formal connection and doesn’t check if all data arrives. This makes it perfect for activities like streaming videos, online gaming, or real-time communication where speed is more important than perfection.

In short, TCP focuses on accuracy, while UDP focuses on speed. The choice between them depends on what the application needs.

What are Port Numbers?
Port numbers help manage multiple services or applications running on the same device within a network. They ensure that data goes to the correct application. Port numbers range from 0 to 65535 and are categorized as follows:

Well-Known Ports (0-1023): Used for common services like HTTP (port 80) and FTP (port 21).
Registered Ports (1024-49151): Assigned to specific applications or services that are not in the well-known range.
Dynamic/Private Ports (49152-65535): Reserved for temporary or private use by applications.
Ports are like doors in a building; each one leads to a specific room (or application) within the device.

What is Encryption at Rest and in Transit?
Encryption is a method of securing data by converting it into a code that only authorized users can read. Encryption can protect data when it’s stored (at rest) or being transmitted (in transit).

Encryption at Rest: This secures data that is stored on devices or servers. Even if someone gains access to the physical storage, they won’t be able to read the data without the proper keys. This is important for keeping sensitive information safe from unauthorized access.

Encryption in Transit: This protects data while it’s being sent from one device to another. It ensures that even if the data is intercepted during transmission, it cannot be understood without the decryption keys. Common protocols for this include HTTPS for web browsing and TLS/SSL for securing other types of network traffic.
