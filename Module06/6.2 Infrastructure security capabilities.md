# Infrastructure Security Tools and Capabilities

In this section, we’ll dive into some key tools and capabilities that are essential for securing infrastructure.


**Overview**

In this lesson, we’ll explore:

- What is vulnerability management?
- What is CSPM?
- What is CNAPP?

## What is Vulnerability Management?

Vulnerability management is the process of finding, assessing, and fixing security weaknesses in your computer systems, software, and networks. The goal is to protect your organization from cyber threats by fixing these weaknesses before hackers can exploit them. The main steps in vulnerability management are:

- **Finding Vulnerabilities:** Scanning systems like servers, applications, and network devices to spot any weaknesses.
- **Assessing Vulnerabilities:** Evaluating how serious each weakness is and what impact it could have, often using tools like the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).
- **Prioritizing Risks:** Ranking the weaknesses by their risk level to decide which ones to fix first.
- **Fixing Issues:** Implementing solutions, such as applying patches, adjusting security settings, or adding security measures.
- **Verifying Fixes:** Checking to make sure the solutions worked and the weaknesses are gone.
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continuously scanning for new vulnerabilities and keeping an eye on potential threats.

Vulnerability management is a key part of cybersecurity, helping organizations stay safe and prevent security breaches. Some examples of tools used for this are Defender for Cloud, Nessus, and Qualys.

## What is CSPM?

Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) involves tools and practices that help secure cloud environments. It’s about making sure that your cloud setup, whether it’s on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or another provider, follows best practices and stays secure. CSPM tools do the following:

- **Checking Configurations:** Scanning cloud resources to find any security misconfigurations or settings that aren't secure.
- **Enforcing Security Policies:** Ensuring that security rules are followed across your cloud setup, either by automatically fixing issues or by sending alerts.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Keeping a constant watch over your cloud security, with real-time alerts for any incidents.
- **Compliance Reporting:** Creating reports to show that your cloud environment meets regulatory and industry standards.

CSPM helps ensure that your cloud infrastructure is secure, reducing the risk of security incidents. Some examples of CSPM tools include Defender for Cloud and Snyk.

## What is CNAPP?

CNAPP, or Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform, is a comprehensive software solution that helps secure cloud environments and applications. It brings together various tools into one platform to simplify cloud security for DevOps and DevSecOps teams. CNAPP provides security throughout the entire application lifecycle, from development to production. Some key features of CNAPP include:

- **Enhanced Visibility:** Providing a clear view of security across your cloud environment.
- **Risk Assessment:** Quantifying and responding to security risks.
- **Secure Development:** Ensuring that applications are built securely from the start.
- **Integrated Security Solutions:** Combining tools like container scanning, infrastructure as code scanning, and runtime cloud workload protection into one platform.

CNAPP helps organizations manage and secure their cloud applications more effectively, providing a unified interface for various cloud security tasks.
