# Understanding Data Security Tools

This section will explore the key tools and techniques used to protect data:

**Overview**

In this lesson, you'll learn about:

- What is data loss prevention?
- What is insider risk management?
- What tools are available for data retention?

## What is Data Loss Prevention?

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools are software solutions that help keep sensitive or confidential data secure. They prevent unauthorized access, sharing, or leakage of important information within an organization. DLP tools work by inspecting content, enforcing policies, and monitoring data to ensure it stays protected. Examples include Symantec Data Loss Prevention, McAfee Total Protection for Data Loss Prevention, and **Microsoft 365 DLP**, which integrates with Microsoft 365 to safeguard data in emails, documents, and messages.

## What is Insider Risk Management?

Insider Risk Management tools help detect and manage risks that come from within an organization, such as employees, contractors, or partners who might unintentionally or intentionally compromise data security. These tools monitor how users behave, what data they access, and how they use it to spot any suspicious activities. Examples include Microsoft Insider Risk Management (part of Microsoft 365), Forcepoint Insider Threat Data Protection, and Varonis Insider Threat Detection.

## What is Data Retention?

Data retention tools are designed to manage how long data is stored and when it should be deleted according to an organization's policies and legal requirements. These tools automate the retention and secure deletion of data that is no longer needed. Examples include Veritas Enterprise Vault, Commvault Complete Data Protection, and Microsoft's data lifecycle management. These tools ensure that organizations follow data protection laws and efficiently manage data from creation to disposal.
