# Understanding AI Security Capabilities

## What tools do we have to protect AI systems today?

There are several tools available that help secure AI systems:

- **Counterfit**: An open-source tool that automates security testing for AI systems. It helps organizations assess AI security risks and strengthen their algorithms.
- **Adversarial Machine Learning Tools**: These tools test how well machine learning models stand up to adversarial attacks, helping to spot and fix vulnerabilities.
- **AI Security Toolkits**: Open-source toolkits that offer resources like libraries and frameworks for implementing security in AI systems.
- **Collaborative Platforms**: These are partnerships between companies and AI communities that create AI-specific security tools, like scanners, to protect the AI supply chain.

These tools and collaborations are part of a growing effort to make AI systems more secure against various threats. They combine research, practical tools, and industry partnerships to tackle the unique challenges AI presents.

## What is AI red teaming, and how is it different from traditional security red teaming?

AI red teaming focuses on the specific vulnerabilities of AI systems and differs from traditional security red teaming in a few ways:

- **Targeting AI Systems**: AI red teaming zeroes in on the unique risks of AI, like machine learning models and data pipelines, rather than traditional IT systems.
- **Testing AI Responses**: It tests how AI systems react to unusual or unexpected inputs, which can uncover vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.
- **Exploring AI Failures**: AI red teaming looks at a wide range of potential failures, not just security breaches, but also how AI might fail in non-malicious ways.
- **Prompt Injection and Content Issues**: It includes testing for issues like prompt injection, where attackers trick AI into generating harmful or incorrect content.
- **Ensuring Ethical AI**: AI red teaming is also about making sure AI systems are designed to be responsible and robust against being misused.

In short, AI red teaming is a broader practice that not only checks for security flaws but also tests for other potential problems specific to AI. It plays a crucial role in building safer AI systems by identifying and addressing the new risks that come with AI.
