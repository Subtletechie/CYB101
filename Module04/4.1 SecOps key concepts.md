# Key Concepts of Security Operations

Security operations are vital for protecting an organization's digital assets and maintaining overall security. In this lesson, we will explore the following topics:

- What is a security operations function in a business?
- What are the different forms of security operations?
- How do security operations differ from traditional IT operations?

## What Is a Security Operations Function in a Business?

A security operations function refers to a dedicated team or department within a business that is responsible for monitoring, detecting, investigating, and responding to cybersecurity threats and incidents. The main goal of this function is to protect the organization's digital assets by identifying potential security risks and responding quickly to any security incidents. This helps ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organization’s data and systems.

## What Forms Can Security Operations Take?

Security operations can be structured in various ways depending on the organization's size and needs. Some common forms include:

**Security Operations Center (SOC):** A centralized team that works around the clock to monitor, analyze, and respond to security events in real-time using advanced tools and technologies.

**Incident Response Team:** A specialized group that focuses on managing and responding to security incidents, conducting investigations, and helping the organization recover from breaches.

**Threat Hunting Team:** A proactive team that searches for signs of advanced threats and hidden vulnerabilities that might not be detected by regular security tools.

**Red Team/Blue Team:** The red team simulates attacks to find vulnerabilities, while the blue team works to defend against these attacks. Together, they help improve the organization’s security measures.

**Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP):** Some organizations choose to outsource their security operations to external providers who specialize in monitoring security and responding to incidents.

## How Do Security Operations Differ from Traditional IT Operations?

While security operations and traditional IT operations are related, they have distinct differences:

**Focus:** IT operations are focused on managing and maintaining the organization's IT infrastructure to ensure it runs smoothly. Security operations prioritize identifying and addressing security risks and managing incidents.

**Responsibilities:** IT operations handle tasks like system maintenance, software updates, and user support, while security operations focus on detecting threats, responding to incidents, managing vulnerabilities, and monitoring security.

**Timeliness:** IT operations aim for immediate system availability and performance, while security operations focus on timely detection and resolution of security threats, which may not always align with immediate system availability.

**Skillset:** Security operations require specialized knowledge in threat analysis, incident response, and cybersecurity tools. IT operations require skills in system administration, network management, and application support.

## Incident Response Workflow

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework outlines five key functions that organizations should continuously perform to reduce cybersecurity risks. These functions should be integrated into the organization’s broader cybersecurity processes to create a cohesive security strategy.
