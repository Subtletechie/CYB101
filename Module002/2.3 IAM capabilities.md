# IAM Capabilities

In this section, weâ€™ll explore the essential tools and features that are used to secure identities in cybersecurity.

## Introduction

In this lesson, you'll learn about:

- What a directory service is.
  
- The different ways to protect identities, including:

  - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  - Single Sign-On (SSO)
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - Adaptive Authentication
  - Biometric Authentication
  - Privileged Access Management (PAM)
  - Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)
  - Behavioral Analytics

## What is a Directory Service?

A directory service is like a digital phonebook for an organization's network. It keeps track of users, groups, devices, and applications, making it easier to manage who has access to what. This central system helps with tasks like user authentication (making sure users are who they say they are) and authorization (deciding what resources users can access).

Directory services are key to identity and access management (IAM) because they help keep everything secure and organized. One of the most popular directory services is Microsoft Active Directory, but there are others like LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).

Some important functions of a directory service include:

- **User Authentication**: Verifies user credentials (like passwords) to allow only authorized users to access the network.
- **User Authorization**: Controls what each user can do based on their role or group.
- **Group Management**: Lets administrators manage users by grouping them, which simplifies access control.
- **Password Policies**: Enforces rules for password strength and expiration to enhance security.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allows users to access multiple systems with one set of login details.
- **Centralized User Management**: Keeps all user information in one place, making it easier to manage.
- **Auditing and Logging**: Records user activities for security checks and compliance.

## What Capabilities Can Be Used to Secure Identities?

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring multiple forms of verification before access is granted. This often includes something you know (like a password), something you have (like a phone), and something you are (like a fingerprint).

**Single Sign-On (SSO)**

SSO simplifies the login process by letting users access multiple applications with one set of credentials. This reduces the hassle of managing different passwords and improves security.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

RBAC assigns access permissions based on roles within an organization. This means users get the access they need based on their job functions.

**Adaptive Authentication**

Adaptive authentication adjusts the security level required based on factors like where you are, what device you're using, and your typical behavior. If something seems off, it may require extra verification.

**Biometric Authentication**

Biometric authentication uses physical traits like fingerprints or facial recognition to verify identity, making it a secure and convenient way to log in.

**Privileged Access Management (PAM)**

PAM ensures that access to sensitive systems is tightly controlled, especially for privileged accounts. It includes features like granting access only when needed and monitoring sessions.

**Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)**

IGA manages the entire lifecycle of user identities, from onboarding to offboarding, ensuring that access is properly controlled and maintained.

**Behavioral Analytics**

Behavioral analytics tracks user behavior to identify unusual activity. If something doesn't match typical patterns, it can trigger an alert for further investigation.
