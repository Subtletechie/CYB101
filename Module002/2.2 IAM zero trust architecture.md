# IAM and Zero Trust Architecture

Identity is crucial for implementing a Zero Trust architecture and creating a secure environment in any IT setup. In this lesson, we’ll dive into why identity controls are important and how they help build a Zero Trust approach.

## Introduction

In this lesson, we’ll explore:

- Why do we use identity as our main security perimeter in today’s IT environments?
  
- How is this different from traditional IT security models?

- How do we use identity to implement a Zero Trust architecture?

## Why Use Identity as the Perimeter in Modern IT?

In today’s IT environments, the old idea of protecting everything with physical boundaries (like firewalls) is no longer enough. With the rise of remote work and cloud services, organizations are now focusing on identity as the new security perimeter. This means that instead of just protecting the network, security is about confirming who is trying to access resources, whether it’s a user, device, or application, no matter where they are.

Here’s why using identity as the perimeter is important today:

**Remote Work**: Many people now work remotely, using various devices from different locations. Traditional security models don’t work well when users aren’t in a physical office.

**Cloud and Hybrid Setups**: More organizations are using cloud services, meaning data and apps are no longer only on the company’s physical premises. This makes traditional defenses less effective.

**Zero Trust**: Zero Trust means never automatically trusting any entity, whether it’s inside or outside the network. Identity becomes the key to verifying every access request, no matter where it comes from.

**Evolving Threats**: Cyberattacks are getting smarter, and attackers are finding ways around traditional defenses. They often target people through phishing or social engineering, making it essential to focus on identity.

**Data Protection**: Protecting sensitive data is vital. By focusing on identity, organizations can better control who has access to what data, reducing the chance of breaches.

## How Is This Different from Traditional IT Security?

Traditional IT security relied heavily on physical boundaries like firewalls to keep threats out. But as technology has evolved, so has the approach to security. Here’s a comparison between traditional security and today’s identity-focused approach:

| **Aspect**                | **Traditional IT Security**                                             | **Identity-Centric Security**                                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                 | Relied on perimeter defenses like firewalls.                             | Focuses on verifying the identity of users and devices.               |
| **Location**              | Security tied to physical locations and network boundaries.              | Security is location-independent; access can be from anywhere.        |
| **Trust**                 | Assumed trust for anything within the network perimeter.                 | Zero Trust: Never assumes trust; always verifies identity and context.|
| **Devices**               | Assumed devices within the network were secure.                          | Considers device security regardless of location.                     |
| **Data Protection**       | Focused on securing the network perimeter to protect data.               | Focuses on controlling access to data based on identity and sensitivity.|

## How Is Identity Used in Zero Trust?

In a Zero Trust architecture, the main idea is to never trust any entity automatically, whether it’s inside or outside the network. Identity is at the core of this by ensuring continuous verification of anyone or anything trying to access resources. This involves confirming digital identity through various methods like usernames, passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), biometrics, and other strong authentication techniques.
