# AI Security: Key Concepts Explained for Students

## How Does AI Security Differ from Traditional Cybersecurity?

AI security introduces unique challenges that differ from traditional cybersecurity because of AI's ability to learn and make decisions. Here’s how they differ:

- **Data Integrity**: AI systems learn by analyzing data. Ensuring that this data is accurate is critical because if attackers tamper with the data, they can alter the AI's behavior, a tactic known as data poisoning.
- **Model Security**: The decision-making model of an AI can be targeted by attackers. They might try to reverse-engineer the model or exploit its weaknesses to force the AI into making incorrect or harmful decisions.
- **Adversarial Attacks**: AI can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks where small, often invisible changes to input data can lead the AI to make mistakes or incorrect predictions.
- **Infrastructure Security**: While protecting infrastructure is important in traditional cybersecurity, AI systems may require extra attention due to their complexity, including cloud services or specialized hardware.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Using AI in security raises ethical issues, such as concerns about privacy and potential bias in AI decisions. These must be addressed as part of the security strategy.

Securing AI systems requires a different approach that takes into account the specific needs of AI technology, such as protecting data and models, while also considering the ethical issues involved in using AI.

## How Does AI Security Compare to Traditional IT Security?

AI security and traditional cybersecurity share several fundamental principles:

- **Threat Protection**: Both AI and traditional systems must be protected from unauthorized access, data modification, destruction, and other common threats.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Just like traditional systems, AI systems can be affected by vulnerabilities such as software bugs or configuration errors.
- **Data Security**: Protecting data is vital in both AI and traditional cybersecurity to prevent breaches and ensure confidentiality.
- **Supply Chain Security**: Both AI and traditional systems are at risk of supply chain attacks, where a compromised component can weaken the entire system's security.

While AI security introduces new challenges, it also relies on established cybersecurity practices to provide strong protection. It's about combining traditional security knowledge with an understanding of AI’s unique characteristics.
